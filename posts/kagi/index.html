So, I decided to try Kagi, a subscription-based search engine. What sealed the deal was learning about their privacy protections: Kagi proxies all images to prevent tracking from third parties and uses HTTPS encryption across their platform.\nAfter six months with Kagi, here are the standout benefits. (Why Kagi Might Be a Great Fit) Possibly the main draw for me is the ad-free experience. Without ads, everything feels cleaner. This is especially valuable for professionals and researchers who need distraction-free access to information without endless banners and pop-ups. If you’re worried about digital footprints or potential data misuse, Kagi provides some peace of mind. I particularly appreciate Kagi’s “Lenses” feature, which lets me control exactly which websites appear in my search results. The “Small Web” lens has become one of my favorites, as it restricts searches to Kagi’s curated Small Web repository, helping me discover thoughtful independent content rather than just the usual commercial giants. The Personalized Results function gives control over how specific domains are displayed. You can elevate, demote, completely remove, or permanently feature certain websites in your search outcomes. Managing these preferences is straightforward; simply click the shield icon next to any result to access these customization options directly from the search page. I like Kagi’s balanced approach to AI. Rather than generating potentially inaccurate answers, it intelligently summarizes information from reliable sources while always citing where the information came from. As a personal note, I’ve seen how Kagi helps protect less tech-savvy users. Many older relatives, friends, and clients struggle to tell legitimate websites from scams or misleading content. Kagi’s focus on quality sources makes browsing safer for everyone, particularly those who didn’t grow up with the internet and might not recognize online threats as easily. Minuses (Where Kagi Could Improve) I’ll admit that after years in Google’s ecosystem, Kagi’s design took some getting used to. While I appreciate its clean layout, I sometimes find myself missing Google’s familiar interface. Just last week, I spent an extra minute figuring out how to filter results by date in Kagi—something I could do almost automatically in Google. The learning curve isn’t steep, but there’s no denying that Google has spent decades perfecting its user experience. Kagi prioritizes function over familiarity, which means occasional moments of “Where is that feature again?” as you adapt to the new system. When it comes to navigation and location research, I still find myself switching back to Google. Last month, while planning a weekend trip to Vancouver, Kagi’s mapping capabilities couldn’t provide the detailed street views, business hours, and real-time traffic updates I needed.Google Maps remains unmatched for me.\nIs Kagi perfect? No search engine is. But after six months, I can confidently say switching was one of my best digital decisions. What initially seemed like a small upgrade has changed how I interact with information online. The ability to customize search results by upranking trusted sources, downranking problematic sites, and blacklisting domains I never want to see again is genuinely revolutionary (something Google could have implemented years ago but never did). I honestly can’t remember the last time I needed to use the !g command to redirect to Google. If you’re on the fence about trying Kagi, I encourage you to take the plunge. Yes, the initial setup to make it your default search engine requires a few extra steps, but the instructions are clear, and it’s a one-time process that pays dividends every day.\n",
