      <title>Why I Switched to Kagi (And What Happened Next)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I switched to Kagi in March 2025 - Iâ€™d been disappointed for a while and wanted a fresh approach to searching online. I decided it was time for a change after three major frustrations with Google: the flood of low-quality and spammy websites cluttering my search results, the constant interruption from targeted advertisements during research, and serious concerns about how my personal data was being collected and used. I wanted a search engine that could deliver trustworthy information without tracking my every move or prioritizing advertisers over actual answers.
So, I decided to try Kagi, a subscription-based search engine. What sealed the deal was learning about their privacy protections: Kagi proxies all images to prevent tracking from third parties and uses HTTPS encryption across their platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-ai-adoption-gap&#34;&gt;The AI Adoption Gap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on in my career as a producer in the game industry, I was already experimenting with AI tools, long before &amp;ldquo;generative AI&amp;rdquo; became the talk of the town. I had a hunch that LLMs held enormous potential not just for programming but for every aspect of game development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-debugging-to-art-the-ai-adoption-gap&#34;&gt;From Debugging to Art: The AI Adoption Gap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the technical side of my projects, we embraced AI pretty readily: LLM-based assistance helped squash bugs, write unit tests, and provide code reviews. Tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor.com integrated seamlessly into our pipelines; my dev team loved the productivity boost and was far from intimidated. However, the story was different in the art and design departments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
