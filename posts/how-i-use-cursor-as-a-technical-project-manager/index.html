I train my team to work the same way. At our company, we use Cursor. It’s the same tool our engineers and technical specialists use daily, which already makes it a natural fit for managing technical work. But it goes further. Cursor runs fast as a desktop app, supports markdown with live previews, integrates directly with Jira, Confluence, and Notion through MCPs, and gives me access to multiple LLMs in one place. I don’t have to jump between tools or reformat the same content twice.\nWhy Technical PMs Should Be Using Cursor If you need to make the case for getting Cursor licenses for your product or project management team, here’s a clear list of reasons it’s worth it.\nMulti-Model Access Cursor lets you access multiple LLMs - GPT-5, Claude, DeepSeek, etc. — and switch between them easily. This gives PMs flexibility to get different responses, tones, or strengths from various models without changing platforms.\nBuilt-In File System + Markdown Support It provides a full file system interface, allowing you to work directly with .md files: writing, storing, editing, and syncing them like a developer would. As a PM, you can write your PRD, TDD, architecture notes, etc., in markdown and see a live preview (with the Markdown Preview Enhanced plugin).\nSpeed \u0026 Desktop-Native Unlike web tools, Cursor runs as a desktop app and is fast. That makes a difference when you’re writing, navigating files, or pushing/pulling content to other tools.\nIntegration via MCPs Cursor connects directly to tools like Jira, Notion, Confluence, GitHub, Figma, etc., all from within the same interface. You don’t have to jump between platforms or copy-paste.\nSource Control for Docs PRDs and technical documents live inside the code repo (via Git). That’s a huge shift: you’re working where the engineers work, using the same tools and versioning everything.\nFast Iteration with AI Agents + Context You can set Cursor rules for how the AI should behave, like always linking Jira tickets to epics or pulling comments from Confluence. These rules let you scale repeatable tasks.\nA Shared Environment With Engineering Cursor puts you in the same operational space as engineers. That shared context makes collaboration smoother.\nIn this post, I’ll walk through exactly how I use Cursor as a technical project manager, step by step.\nStep 1: Set Up Cursor as Your Operating Environment Install Cursor Enable Markdown Preview Enhanced: Lets you view your docs as rendered content, not raw syntax. Create a new folder per project, e.g., /project-infra-revamp-q4/ README.md → Product Requirement Doc (PRD) jira_tickets.md → Task breakdowns status_report.md → Weekly async updates architecture.md → Flow diagrams and data interfaces Use the Three-Pane Layout File explorer on the left Markdown content (PRD, tickets, etc.) in the center AI chat on the right Set this up once. Every project runs in this structure.\nStep 2: Connect Cursor to the Right MCPs Start by connecting Cursor to the tools you actually use on the project. These integrations are called MCPs (Model Context Protocols), and they let Cursor push and pull content across your entire workflow.\nSet up only what matters You don’t need everything. Just connect the MCPs that make sense for your stack. For example, I usually enable: - Jira - Confluence - Notion - GitHub - Figma\nToggle MCPs based on your workflow You don’t have to keep everything on all the time. Cursor lets you toggle MCPs on or off depending on what you’re working on. For example: - Writing tickets? Enable Jira only. - Reviewing a design spec? Turn on Figma. - Publishing a doc? Enable Confluence or Notion.\nKeep an eye on the green status light for each MCP. If something’s not syncing, it’s usually because the MCP needs to be re-enabled.\nStep 3: Write the PRD in Markdown (Inside Cursor) Structure your README.md, which is your PRD, like this:\n# [Project Name] ## Summary One paragraph clearly explaining what the project is and what outcome it drives. ## Scope Define what’s in scope and what’s explicitly out of scope. List your connected MCPs and relevant tools. ## Architecture Overview Describe the high-level system design or attach a diagram via markdown image links. Make this useful for engineers, designers, and reviewers. ## Component Breakdown Use the same structure for each key component (or module): - Name of component (e.g., Ingestion Pipeline, Model Scoring API) - Owner - Inputs and outputs - Success criteria ## Timeline Create a simple table or bullet list of major milestones and their deadlines. ## Risks and Mitigation List 3–5 key risks and what you're doing to mitigate them. ## Communication Plan Define how stakeholders will stay informed (e.g., async updates via `status_report.md`, weekly Jira summaries). Once this is complete, commit the file to your Git repo. This becomes the living source of truth for the project.\nStep 4: Push the PRD to Confluence or Notion Once your PRD is ready in markdown, publish it using the Confluence or Notion MCP. This allows other teams to view and comment without needing access to Cursor or the Git repo.\nUse this process: Use Cursor to run the MCP push command The AI will generate a clean, formatted version in your chosen tool Add the link back to the original markdown doc for easy reference Pro tip: Do this early, even with a rough draft. Share the published link in your team’s PRD channel to collect feedback asynchronously.\nStep 5: Generate Jira Tickets from Your PRD Create a jira_tickets.md file and list your deliverables in plain text under each component or epic.\nExample:\n## Component: Ingestion Pipeline - Define schema - Build ingestion job - Validate outputs ## Component: Model Evaluation - Create test harness - Run accuracy benchmarks Then prompt Cursor: \u003e “Convert this into Jira tickets. Include summary, description, labels, epic link, and link to the PRD.”\nCursor will: - Generate well-structured tickets with technical descriptions - Link them to the right epics - Format them for Jira import (CSV or API)\nOnce reviewed, import into Jira. Each component maps to an epic, and each bullet becomes a story.\nStep 6: Automate Weekly Status Reports Use the status_report.md to summarize project progress every week. Cursor can generate the content using real-time data from Jira.\nSteps: Open status_report.md Prompt: \u003e “Generate a weekly status update from Jira. Group by epic. Include status, blockers, % done, and recent progress.” Cursor reads ticket history and outputs a readable update per component. Paste the final update into Slack, Confluence, or email it to stakeholders.\nStep 7: Monitor, Iterate, and Stay in Sync Once setup is done, keep your project moving by: - Updating Jira daily - Committing any PRD edits to Git - Regenerating status reports weekly - Toggling MCPs as needed\nWith this setup, you’re working in the same system as engineers, using AI to eliminate busywork, and staying async by default. No context switching. No double entry. Just execution at speed.\n",

</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>One paragraph clearly explaining what the project is and what outcome it drives.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## Scope
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>Define what’s in scope and what’s explicitly out of scope. List your connected MCPs and relevant tools.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## Architecture Overview
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>Describe the high-level system design or attach a diagram via markdown image links. Make this useful for engineers, designers, and reviewers.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## Component Breakdown
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>Use the same structure for each key component (or module):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Name of component (e.g., Ingestion Pipeline, Model Scoring API)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Owner
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Inputs and outputs
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Success criteria
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## Timeline
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>Create a simple table or bullet list of major milestones and their deadlines.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## Risks and Mitigation
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>List 3–5 key risks and what you&#39;re doing to mitigate them.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## Communication Plan
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>Define how stakeholders will stay informed (e.g., async updates via <span style="color:#e6db74">`status_report.md`</span>, weekly Jira summaries).
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once this is complete, commit the file to your Git repo. This becomes
the living source of truth for the project.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-push-the-prd-to-confluence-or-notion">Step 4: Push the PRD to Confluence or Notion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-4-push-the-prd-to-confluence-or-notion">#</a></h2>
<p>Once your PRD is ready in markdown, publish it using the Confluence or
Notion MCP. This allows other teams to view and comment without needing
access to Cursor or the Git repo.</p>
<h3 id="use-this-process">Use this process:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#use-this-process">#</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Use Cursor to run the MCP push command</li>
<li>The AI will generate a clean, formatted version in your chosen tool</li>
<li>Add the link back to the original markdown doc for easy reference</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Do this early, even with a rough draft. Share the published
link in your team&rsquo;s PRD channel to collect feedback asynchronously.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-generate-jira-tickets-from-your-prd">Step 5: Generate Jira Tickets from Your PRD<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-5-generate-jira-tickets-from-your-prd">#</a></h2>
<p>Create a <code>jira_tickets.md</code> file and list your deliverables in plain text
under each component or epic.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## Component: Ingestion Pipeline
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Define schema
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Build ingestion job
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Validate outputs
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## Component: Model Evaluation
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Create test harness
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Run accuracy benchmarks
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then prompt Cursor: &gt; &ldquo;Convert this into Jira tickets. Include summary,
description, labels, epic link, and link to the PRD.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cursor will: - Generate well-structured tickets with technical
descriptions - Link them to the right epics - Format them for Jira
import (CSV or API)</p>
<p>Once reviewed, import into Jira. Each component maps to an epic, and
each bullet becomes a story.</p>
<h2 id="step-6-automate-weekly-status-reports">Step 6: Automate Weekly Status Reports<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-6-automate-weekly-status-reports">#</a></h2>
<p>Use the <code>status_report.md</code> to summarize project progress every week.
Cursor can generate the content using real-time data from Jira.</p>
<h3 id="steps">Steps:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#steps">#</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Open <code>status_report.md</code></li>
<li>Prompt: &gt; &ldquo;Generate a weekly status update from Jira. Group by
epic. Include status, blockers, % done, and recent progress.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>Cursor reads ticket history and outputs a readable update per component.
Paste the final update into Slack, Confluence, or email it to
stakeholders.</p>
<h2 id="step-7-monitor-iterate-and-stay-in-sync">Step 7: Monitor, Iterate, and Stay in Sync<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-7-monitor-iterate-and-stay-in-sync">#</a></h2>
<p>Once setup is done, keep your project moving by: - Updating Jira daily -
Committing any PRD edits to Git - Regenerating status reports weekly -
Toggling MCPs as needed</p>
<p>With this setup, you&rsquo;re working in the same system as engineers, using
AI to eliminate busywork, and staying async by default. No context
switching. No double entry. Just execution at speed.</p>
