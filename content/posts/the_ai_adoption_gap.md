# The AI Adoption Gap

Early on in my career as a producer in the game industry, I was already experimenting with AI tools, long before "generative AI" became the talk of the town. I had a hunch that LLMs held enormous potential not just for programming but for every aspect of game development.

## From Debugging to Art: The AI Adoption Gap 

On the technical side of my projects, we embraced AI pretty readily: LLM-based assistance helped squash bugs, write unit tests, and provide code reviews. Tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor.com integrated seamlessly into our pipelines; my dev team loved the productivity boost and was far from intimidated. However, the story was different in the art and design departments.

When I tried to encourage my artists and designers to give AI-driven tools a shot—particularly generative AI models that could help with concept art or asset placeholders—I was met with skepticism and a fair bit of resistance. Some of the most talented people I've worked with for years suddenly looked at me like I'd asked them to outsource their entire creative process to a "heartless chatbot." I realized then that my role as a producer isn't just to worry about budgets and timelines, but also to be an effective advocate for new technology.

One of the first big problems I ran into while trying to integrate AI was the lack of basic knowledge about Generative AI—people had this imaginary picture in their minds, something far scarier and more futuristic than it really is. A lot of my artists expected to see some kind of "general AI" just around the corner. We delved into neural networks, the basics of transformer architectures, and how models "learn" from massive datasets. This helped dispel misconceptions and reduce that intangible fear that "AI is about to replace us all." The real emphasis was on helping people make informed decisions about which tools they use. And because this was a company-wide effort, we had a bunch of technical folks jumping in to share their own success stories with AI—stories that encouraged the artists and gave them that extra motivation to maybe try it out for smaller, less creative tasks.

For many on the creative side, hearing positive success stories from the dev team—like how an LLM might handle the mundane parts of coding or how text-to-image tools generate placeholder art—became pivotal. It showed them AI could simplify the repetitive tasks they don't enjoy, freeing them up to focus on what truly sparks their creativity.

## Tactic #2: Respect Creative Autonomy

Creatives generally hate being told how to work—and I get that. We never made AI tools mandatory. Instead, we framed it as a personal choice of work style: If you can stay productive without AI, go for it. If AI can lighten your workload or speed up production, give it a try. My job is to make sure the option is there, so you can make an informed decision.

This voluntary approach took the pressure off. It also aligned with our overarching policy: we only care about the final result, not exactly how you get there. Once the pressure was gone, many artists were more willing to experiment. Some ended up exploring text-based concept generation and found it inspiring to see how quickly new ideas could be prototyped.

## Tactic #3: Address Job Security and the 80/20 Rule

Underneath the skepticism, people often worry about losing their jobs to AI. Let's be honest: Everyone from artists to customer support specialists is wondering if a machine's going to edge them out. In talking to my team, I referred to the Pareto Principle—how 80% of resources typically go into the fundamentals, leaving just 20% for fresh, innovative ideas. We frequently shelved brilliant game design proposals simply because there wasn't enough time or budget.

I believe AI can flip that ratio. Imagine a future where the routine, less creative tasks are automated, freeing up more resources for genuine innovation. Instead of spending days pushing pixels to create minor variations of the same in-game asset, the artist can focus on crafting the overall artistic vision while an AI model handles repetitive generation. It's about harnessing technology to amplify creativity, not replace it.

## The Flash Moment

If you've been in the industry long enough, you probably remember the days of Adobe Flash. At its peak, Flash felt indispensable—you couldn't launch a multimedia project without it. But when newer, better technologies came along, Flash faded out of existence. We witnessed huge hesitation and doom-and-gloom predictions back then, too. Ultimately, people adapted, learned new tools, and carried on creating great content. AI is seeing the same hesitancy now, but the learning curve won't be insurmountable.

All the same, you never convert everyone overnight—but that's okay. My role as a producer, a "technical manager," and an AI enthusiast is to keep the door open, offer support, and let people discover for themselves how exciting these breakthroughs can be. Whether you use a generative model for concept art or an LLM for debugging, it's your choice. My hope is you'll at least explore the possibilities, because AI isn't just the future—it's here right now.

And I truly believe if we harness AI correctly, we can do more than just meet deadlines. We can tap into that extra 80% worth of untried ideas, unleash our best creative work, and build the kind of breakthrough products that used to feel impossible on a tight schedule.

That's it for now. If this blog post makes you curious, go experiment. If it makes you nervous, remember the Flash example—change is inevitable, but so is human adaptability. And in my experience, once you see how much time AI can save on routine tasks, you'll find more room for the kind of creativity that originally drew many of us into gaming in the first place.
